Fork of https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-CountDownClock

For some reason, this extension doesn't take time zones into account. This slight fork just changes a few lines to put everything into UTC. Enter your end time in UTC YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS and it'll display the correct countdown time for people worldwide.
